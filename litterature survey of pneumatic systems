commonly occurring faults: 
https://www.rowse-pneumatics.co.uk/blog/post/ultimate-pneumatics-guide
      - The most common problems are likely to be a slow-moving or drifting actuator, insufficient pressure, issues with valves or the filtration unit.
      - Low or variable air pressure is often caused by an inadequate compressed air supply to equipment, undersized pipes or tubes, or a spike in demand from other tools or machines on the circuit.
      - Absent or improperly used flow controls can cause cylinders to move too fast and damage themselves, or too slowly to accomplish high-speed operations.
      - Poorly located flow controls can also interfere with cylinder speed control, if access is available to operators pursuing different goals and thus constantly changing the flow rates.
      - Inconsistent stroke can be caused by variable or slow cylinder speeds, owing to low pressure or too small a cylinder. Conversely, too large a cylinder may require too great an airflow and stroke too slowly. Slow or erratic stroke may be due to undersized tubing and valves restricting the airflow.
      - Cylinder banging can occur at system power-up, if the cylinder is left by the load in a retracted position on shutting off the air. When the system is subsequently powered up, air can rush in too rapidly, causing abrupt and potentially dangerous operation. Soft start valves avoid this problem by allowing gradual build-up of pressure.
      - Loud actuation is typically due to absent flow controls or stroke-end cushioning, together with exhaust venting.

environmental conditions:
      - clean and dry air, in sufficient flow to ensure the necessary pressure

      - fundamental performance characteristics are often specified for an operating temperature range of -20°C to 80°C
      - When operating in a potentially corrosive environment, you need to consider a final product selection specially designed for the challenge. In a dry and non-aggressive environment, a cylinder with a chromium steel piston rod will normally suffice.
      - in humid operating environments such as those with a risk of salt spray, all external cylinder surfaces will need to be coated, and the piston rod should be made of stainless steel
      - deposits on the piston rod can cause issues, e.g., sugar sediment in food equipment or resins, asphalt, and even cement in other applications
      - in food and beverage production, where specific technology of the pneumatic cylinder may be required, you need to choose a variant with special ‘clean’ design features that reduce the number of entrapment points for bacteria
      - An atmosphere with the potential to become explosive during operating conditions (or under the influence of those surroundings) requires a pneumatic cylinder that is ATEX-rated

      - pneumatic systems can work in inflammable environments without the risk of fire or explosion. Unlike of electromotive components, pneumatic system components do not overheat when overloaded and are therefore less of a fire hazard
